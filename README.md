### system requirements
requires python3, pyqt5.
tested only on Ubuntu 16.04.

## features:

 - transparent background
 - invert colors on click

## todo
 - pack/freeze in a single executable
 - use the svg version (i couldn't make it keep aspect ratio on resize, yet)

This project is also an example of floating image on transparent window background (it's not trivial).
